        We all share a <i><b>fundamental</b></i> drive to communicate. 
        Communication can be defined as the process of <i><b>understanding</b></i> and <b><i>sharing</i></b> meaning.
        Pearson, <u>J.</u>, & <u>Nelson</u>, <u>P.</u> (2000). 
        An introduction to human communication: <i><b>understanding</b></i> and <i><b>sharing</b></i> (p. 6). 
        <u>Boston</u>, MA: <u>McGraw-Hill</u>. You share meaning in what you say and how you say it, both in <b><i>oral</i></b> and <b><i>written</i></b> forms. 
        If you could not communicate, what would life be like? 
        A series of never-ending frustrations? 
        Not being able to ask for what you need or even to understand the needs of others?
